## Compilation to wasm

> For compilation to wasm you must have arakoo-compiler and arakoo runtime installed (For installation instruction you can refer the [readme](https://github.com/redoC-A2k/EdgeChains#setup-1))

1. Build the arakoo runtime compatible wasm

```bash
npm run wasm
```

2. Run the wasm with runtime (index.wasm will be in the directory in which you run npm run wasm)

```bash
arakoo index.wasm
```

Now you are good to go send the request to port 8080
